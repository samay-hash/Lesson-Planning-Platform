# 🎓📚

Along with my BTech studies, I have coursework that requires preparing detailed lesson plans in structured formats such as tables, mind maps, and descriptive teaching notes. Manually creating these lesson plans — especially typing everything into Word — was repetitive, time-consuming, and I also didn’t have MS Word installed.

To streamline this process, I built Go Simon — a tool that uses the Gemini API to automatically generate complete lesson plans from just a few inputs. The generated content is then converted into a .docx file using the Officegen npm package, ensuring the final document follows the academic format and structure required in my assignments.

Go Simon helps reduce manual effort, improves consistency, and makes lesson planning faster and more efficient.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: Built with React, Recoil for state management, and TailwindCSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB for data storage, Officegen for `.docx` file generation, Zod for validation, and Axios for API requests.
- **AI Integration**: Uses the Google Gemini API for generating relevant lesson content.

## Features ✨

- **Built to help me and some of my classmates**:


## Future Improvements 🚀

- **UI Enhancements**: I will improve the UI .
- **Backend Optimization**: I will improve the backend also .
- **Lesson Plan Customization**: The teacher specifix lesson plan structure and fee plan will added soon

With each improvement, goSimongo will be more user-friendly, flexible, and efficient, aiming to further reduce the time and effort involved in creating lesson plans.
