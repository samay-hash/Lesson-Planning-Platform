          Creating a lesson plan in Word is too boring , especially when it
          comes to formatting boxes and aligning everything properly. It's one
          of the most frustrating tasks to do on a laptop, so I decided to make
          it easier. Now, you can create a lesson plan quickly and then refine
          it as you like!

          I built goSimongo to simplify lesson planning for educators, so you

          As a B.Ed. trainee and aspiring developer, I saw the challenges
          teachers face in creating lesson plans. Traditional methods are often
          tedious and time-consuming. <br />
          LessonFlow changes that. Powered by the Gemini API, it generates
          structured lesson plans in seconds, letting teachers focus more on
          teaching. I am kidding made this for me so that i dont have to give
          propmt to ai create everything, Thank You GEMINI API , i LOVE YOU
